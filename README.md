# ZoopE - Ride Right. Ride ZoopE

## About the Project
This project aims to develop a rental-based mobile application for e-bicycles, inspired by models like Yulu. The app promotes a healthy lifestyle and aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing eco-friendly transportation. Users can unlock bicycles by their NFC tag or QR code scanning feature, use them for a specific distance, and return them to designated stations. The application integrates features for tracking distance, calculating rental fees based on kilometers traveled, and ensuring bicycles are available at strategic locations. The system1 seeks to enhance urban mobility while addressing environmental and health concerns.
